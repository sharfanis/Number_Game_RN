# Number_Game_RN
A Number guessing game , built using React Native and flexbox.

Using the concepts of react native hooks and flexbox and number guessing game where the algorithm will guess the number which you want computer to guess and will
in the end showcase the number of attempts it took for computer to guess the number you entered initially.

I have used flexbox for styling .
